I was having some difficulties to understanding flexbox and positions in css so on this page based on another page I saw on youtube, i developed while looking for these properties that I had doubts. 
Again, it was based on another project that i saw, but i tried to do it by myself alwats that i could. 
Now I'm trying to create something from zero, it's been a challenge but I'm working on it!
